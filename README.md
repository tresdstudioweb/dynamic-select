# Dynamic Select

Dynamic Select - Statamic Addon

> The Dynamic Select addon for Statamic streamlines the configuration of data relationships using taxonomies. This means that the options displayed in the second selector dynamically adjust based on the choice made in the first selector.
> This enhances user experience by providing an intuitive and personalized selection process, allowing users to focus on and choose only the relevant options based on their initial selection.
> It's essential to emphasize that taxonomies must be interconnected in a one-to-many relationship through dependent fields utilizing a foreign key in the taxonomy that acts as the dependent one.


## Key Features:
